# CV_models
streamlit app of CV models one is using MobileNet and is used to detect the bacterial wilt and other is using VGG16 used to detect the retinal diseases.
dataset for bacterial wilt taken from: (  Yigezu, Mesay Gemeda, Michael Melese Woldeyohannis, and Atnafu Lambebo Tonja.

Retinal dataset taken from kaggle titled as: Retinal OCT Images (optical coherence tomography)

The folder crack segmentation contains a YOLO model trained to segment the cracks in a concrete.
